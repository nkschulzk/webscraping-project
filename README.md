'Wunderground Adjusted'.py is a slightly altered code from my previous drafts, used to scrape precipitaton data, elevation data, etc. from Wunderground.com

'adjust temps'.py feeds in the xlsx from the 'Wunderground Adjusted'.py, merges in a bit of manually collected data on ski resorts across Europe, South Korea, and South America. It adjusts the temperature and snow day projections for the resort elevation, adjusting utilizing a couple of assumptions.
